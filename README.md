# Introduction
***
Wind energy has emerged as a promising alternative source for overcoming the energy crisis in the world. Wind power based energy is one of the most rapidly growing areas among the renewable energy sources and will continue to do so because of the growing concern about sustainability and emission reduction requirements. The uncertain nature of wind and high penetration of wind energy in power systems are a big challenge to the reliability and stability of these systems. To make wind energy a reliable source, accurate models for predicting the power output and performance monitoring of wind turbines are needed. 

We will use Linear Regression approach to modelling the relationship between wind speed dependent variable to predict turbine power independent variable.

The study of the project will be focus on how to perform and explain simple linear regression using Python on the powerproduction and the goal is to accurately predict wind turbine power output from wind speed values using data set as a basis.

## Problem Statement
***

In this project you must perform and explain simple linear regression using Python
on the powerproduction dataset available on Moodle. The goal is to accurately predict wind turbine power output from wind speed values using the data set as a basis.
Your submission must be in the form of a git repository containing, at a minimum, the
following items:
1. Jupyter notebook that performs simple linear regression on the data set.
2. In that notebook, an explanation of your regression and an analysis of its accuracy.
3. Standard items in a git repository such as a README.
To enhance your submission, you might consider comparing simple linear regression to
other types of regression on this data set. Rest assured, all the above concepts will be
explored in lecture videos and other materials in the coming semester.
